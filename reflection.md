# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.

I converted many of the functions to run on pointers instead of objects and stored many of these as unique pointers. This is where the game really took shape and became a game instead of just an animation

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.

I had a few issues with the unique pointers as well as keepign track of the indexes. Still working on that

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?

Many of the very basics of computer programming. It's really nice to have a product that is (except for the graphics {which is a lot of programming}) mostly your own.
